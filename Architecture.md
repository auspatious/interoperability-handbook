# **Architecture** 

Architecture plays a very important role in enabling interoperability. It describes the organizational structure of concepts, processes, and assets, including data and workflows. It comprises structural aspects of models and standards that govern the collection, storage, arrangement, integration, and use of data, based on which interoperability of data and services are built on.

Following Architecture has impact on Interoperbility
1) Data Architecture
2) Cloud Computing Architecture
3) Data Analytics Architecture 

## Data Architecture
This section will talk about Archival and preservation ..... 
| **ID** | **Recommendations** |
| :---- | :---- |
| **DSTOR\#1** |  |
| **DSTOR\#2** |  |
| **DSTOR\#3** |  |
| **DSTOR\#4** |  |
| **DSTOR\#5** |  |
| **DSTOR\#6** |  |

## Cloud Computing Architecture
The Cloud computing architecture supports standardized API, protocols and provides capability for  publishing resources as services, this enables seamless integration of data and services irrespective of the underlying architecture and location

| **ID** | **Recommendations** |
| :---- | :---- |
| **CLOUD\#1** | The data to be shared through cloud should be converted to cloud optimized formats for faster and interoperable access across multiple applications  |
| **CLOUD\#2** |  |
| **CLOUD\#3** |  |
| **CLOUD\#4** |  |
| **CLOUD\#5** |   |
| **CLOUD\#6** |  |

## Analytics Architecture
Data Analytics architecture in an organization provides capability to store, analyze and visualize the data. As a typical Earth Observation data analytics require a large volume of time series data and hence it is necessary to support interoperability in the analytics architecture using following recommendations.
 
## Analysis Ready Data 
Analysis Ready Data (ARD) are starting point for interoperability in analysis and hence Data Providers are encouraged to develop ARD
## ARD Recommendations
| **ID** | **Recommendations** |
| :---- | :---- |
| **ARD\#1** | CEOS ARD Framework should be used as a starting point for development of Analysis Ready Data |
| **ARD\#2** | CEOS Product Family Specifications (PFS) should be used for development of ARD products. In case if a new ARD is to be developed, use PFS template and submit to CEOS for approval  |
| **ARD\#3** | CEOS ARD compliance of the product requires two level of assessments, first is self assessment (CEOS ARD Self Assessment Guide)  and second is peer review by CEOS Experts |
| **ARD\#4** |  |
| **ARD\#5** |  |

## Datacube
Data Cube provide capability to pack a collection of data and provide capability for fast access and analysis 
## Datacube Recommendations
| **ID** | **Recommendations** |
| :---- | :---- |
| **DCUBE\#1** | The CEOS supported Open Data Cube can be taken as a reference for Data cube implementation |
| **DCUBE\#2** | Data cubes should support spatial and/or temporal dimensions and capability for publishing available variables/properties as metadata |
| **DCUBE\#3** | Data cubes should abstract the underlying data storage architecture to support hybrid data cubes and interoperability among different types of data cubes |
| **DCUBE\#4** | Data cube may contain raw sensor data, analysis ready data or decision ready information. Analysis Reay Data  should be preferred to avoid pre-processing overheads and fast analysis |
| **DCUBE\#5** | Data cubes should be able to publish the supported pre-built analysis functions   |
| **DCUBE\#6** | Data Cubes should provide REST API and OGC web services based access for easy integration of end user applications |
