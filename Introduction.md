For four decades, the [**Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS)**](https://ceos.org) has made significant contributions to advancing the space-based Earth observation (EO) community. [CEOS agencies](https://ceos.org/agencies/) communicate, collaborate, and exchange information on EO data needs, missions, instruments, and measurements, spurring partnerships that lead to collaboration, including the launch of multi-agency missions.  Such cooperative efforts have greatly benefited data users worldwide with well-curated scientific data that serves to inform decision-making and increase understanding of the Earth as an integrated system. The CEOS forum also provides an established means for mutual communication with other organizations on remote sensing developments, needs, and requirements.

Interoperability of data and services in the space-based EO domain is essential due to the importance of EO data in a wide range of applications, including agriculture, climate monitoring, disaster management, and urban planning, as well as the increasing cooperation between public and commercial space actors worldwide. To streamline such collaborative efforts, CEOS developed and published the CEOS Interoperability Handbook 1.1  in 2008. Fifteen years later, the increase in the number of EO satellites and associated complex sensors providing ever-growing volumes of data catering to complex user requirements, compelled CEOS to review the interoperability of data services in the current context and to develop the CEOS Interoperability Handbook 2.0.
The CEOS Interoperability Framework was developed to guide the evolution of this handbook for EO data services. Different entities within CEOS contributed to the development of this Handbook, with the CEOS [**Working Group on Information Systems and Services (WGISS)**](https://ceos.org/ourwork/workinggroups/wgiss/) leading the overall coordination and development effort.

## Purpose

This handbook will help data providers enhance the interoperability of their data and services with those of other organisations, agencies, and countries by proposing standards and best practices in terminology, structure, formats, metadata, quality, and policy. It is intended to help avoid duplication of efforts, reduce costs, and improve the interoperability of EO data and services.
Interoperability also facilitates the integration of global EO data with other data sources, including geostatistics, model data, and forecasts. By combining these sources, users can gain a more comprehensive understanding of various phenomena, such as natural disasters, land use, and climate change at a global level.

Furthermore, adaptation of interoperability recommendations as discussed in this handbook will facilitate data sharing among the scientific community, governments, international organisations and other stakeholders. It can assist in creating a common understanding among users with different backgrounds, interests, and needs. Finally, interoperability goes beyond data sharing.  It can foster collaboration and innovation by enabling the development of new applications, tools, and services that leverage EO data. Such advances are critical for addressing emerging challenges, such as the impacts of changes affecting the climate, natural disasters, water and food security.

## Scope

CEOS Interoperability Handbook Version 2.0 intends to provide guidance to organisations for development of Interoperable Data and Services and help them in measuring their maturity level.  

## Audience

This Handbook is intended for use as a guide by different Space Agencies, New Space Startups and Commercial Data and Service Providers to improve interoperability of data and services.

## Changes with Respect to Version-1

The Handbook version 2.0 of the CEOS Interoperability Handbook represents a significant evolution from the original 2008 version 1.0. While the earlier handbook laid the groundwork for interoperable Earth Observation (EO) systemsâ€”focusing on metadata standards, catalog protocols, and service definitions, the new version responds to a transformed data landscape shaped by cloud-native architectures, open science, and global collaboration.

The Handbook Version 2.0 aims to guide EO data providers, system architects, and policy stakeholders in building interoperable data and service infrastructures. It emphasizes modularity, openness, and machine-actionability, aligning with global initiatives such as the Group on Earth Observations (GEO), FAIR data principles, and open science mandates.
In contrast, the 2008 edition focused on enabling interoperability through shared protocols (e.g., FTP, Z39.50), metadata formats (e.g., DIF, ISO 19115), and service taxonomies. It introduced foundational concepts such as the OAIS model for archiving, the CEOS Catalogue Interoperability Protocol (CIP), and the use of OpenDAP and WMS/WFS/WCS services.
