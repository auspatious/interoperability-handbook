# **Introduction** 

The **Committee for Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS)** during the last three decades has significantly contributed to the advancement of space-based Earth Observation (EO) community efforts. [CEOS Agencies](https://ceos.org/agencies/) communicate, collaborate, and exchange information on EO activities, spurring useful partnerships. CEOS Agencies work together to launch multi-agency collaborative missions, and such cooperative efforts have highly benefited users all around the world. CEOS also provides an established means of communicating with external organizations, enabling CEOS to understand and act upon these organizationsâ€™ EO needs and requirements. 

Interoperability of data and services in the EO domain is essential due to the importance of EO  data in a wide range of applications, including agriculture, climate change monitoring, disaster management, and urban planning, as well as the increasing cooperation of public and commercial space actors worldwide. In order to streamline such collaborative efforts a need for Interoperability for data and services was strongly felt and **CEOS Interoperability Handbook 1.0** was developed in the year 2008\. With the increase in number of EO satellites and associated complex sensors providing ever growing volumes of data catering to complex user requirements, a need was felt to re-look on the interoperability of data services in the current context and development of **CEOS Interoperability Handbook 2.0** was proposed.

**CEOS Interoperability Framework** was developed to guide the development of CEOS Interoperability Handbook for EO data services. Different entities within CEOS contributed towards development of CEOS Interoperability Handbook 2.0. with CEOS **Working Group on Information Systems and Services (WGISS)** as a lead for overall coordination and development of this handbook.

## Purpose 

The interoperability handbook will facilitate development of interoperability of data and services for exchange of EO data among different organizations, agencies, and countries by standardizing terminology, structure, formats, metadata, quality and policy. This handbook will help to avoid duplication of efforts, reduce costs, and improve the quality and quantity of EO data available for decision-making.

Interoperability also supports the integration of global EO data with other data sources, such as geo-statistics, model data, and forecasts. By combining these sources, users can gain a more comprehensive understanding of various phenomena, such as natural disasters, land use, and climate change at global level.

Furthermore, adaptation of interoperability recommendations will facilitate data sharing among the scientific community, governments, international organizations and other stakeholders. It can assist in creating a common understanding among users with different backgrounds, interests, and needs. Finally, interoperability goes beyond data sharing, as it can foster collaboration and innovation by enabling the development of new applications, tools, and services that leverage EO data. Such advances are critical for addressing emerging challenges, such as the impacts of climate change, natural disasters, and food security.

## Scope 

CEOS Interoperability Handbook Version 2.0 intends to provide guidance to the organizations for **development of Interoperable Data and Services** and help them in **measuring their maturity level**.  

##  Audience 

This Handbook is intended to be used as a guide by different **Space Agencies, New Space Startups**  and **Commercial Data and Service Providers** to improve interoperability of their data and services.
