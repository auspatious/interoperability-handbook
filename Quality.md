Quality informs users of the trustworthiness of Earth Observation data and products and to provides a forum for the exchange of information about calibration and validation, including the coordination of cooperative activities.

## Calibration and Validation

Calibration is the process of quantitatively defining a systemâ€™s response to known and controlled signal inputs. Validation, on the other hand, is the process of assessing, by independent means, the quality of the data products derived from those system outputs.

## Cal/Val Recommendations

| **ID** | **Recommendations** |
| :---- | :---- |
| **CALVAL\#1** | [CEOS CAL/VAL portal](https://calvalportal.ceos.org/) can be used as a reference site for accessing agreed good practices and CAL/VAL protocols for  interoperability for Earth observation calibration and validation activities |
| **CALVAL\#2** |The Quality Assurance Framework for Earth Observation [(QA4EO)](https://qa4eo.org/) developed by Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and endorsed by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) should be followed to enable interoperability and quality assessment of earth observation data |
| **CALVAL\#3** | CEOS endorsed [Cal/Val sites](https://calvalportal.ceos.org/web/guest/calvalsites) should be used for calibration and valiation of Earth Observation data |
| **CALVAL\#4** | All products should have associated quality indicators, traceable to reference standards to allows users to access usability of the data for their applications|
| **CALVAL\#5** |  |
| **CALVAL\#6** |  |
