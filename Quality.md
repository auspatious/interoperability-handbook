# Quality

***

Quality informs users of the trustworthiness of Earth Observation data and products. Multiple Calibration and Validation (Cal/Val) groups/venues exist as forums for the exchange of information about understanding, expressing, and improving data quality, along with influencing the interoperability between multiple datasets and products.

## Calibration and Validation

Calibration is the process of quantitatively defining a systemâ€™s response to known and controlled signal inputs. Validation, on the other hand, is the process of assessing, by independent means, the quality of the data products derived from those system outputs.

## Cal/Val Recommendations

| **ID** | **Recommendations** |
| :---- | :---- |
| **CALVAL\#1** | The Measurand and Uncertainty of stated values within products are key to communicating and understanding data quality |
| **CALVAL\#2** | All products should have associated quality indicators, traceable to reference standards to allows users to access usability of the data for their applications|
| **CALVAL\#3** | [CEOS ARD Framewrk](https://ceos.org/ard/) should be used as a starting point for development of Interoperable and Analysis Ready Data |
| **CALVAL\#4** | Post-launch, Level-1 products should be calibrated using CEOS Fiducial Reference Measurements (CEOS-FRM) |
| **CALVAL\#5** |  CEOS endorsed [Cal/Val sites](https://calvalportal.ceos.org/web/guest/calvalsites) and reference network such as [RadCalNet] (https://www.radcalnet.org/#!/) and [SARCalNet](https://www.sarcalnet.org/) should be used for satellite cross-comparison |
| **CALVAL\#6** |The Quality Assurance Framework for Earth Observation [QA4EO](https://qa4eo.org/) developed by Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and endorsed by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) should be followed to enable interoperability and quality assessment of earth observation data |
| **CALVAL\#7** |The Joint Agency Commercial Imagery Evaluation (JACIE) [Best Practices document](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/joint-agency-commercial-imagery-evaluation-jacie-best-practices-remote-sensing-system) can be used as a guideline for standard calibration and validation activites to be performed |
| **CALVAL\#8** |The [ESA Earth Data Assessment Project (EDAP)](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/activities/edap) process provides multiple reporting metrics related to quality |
| **CALVAL\#9** |[CEOS CAL/VAL portal](https://calvalportal.ceos.org/) can be used as a reference site for accessing agreed good practices and CAL/VAL protocols for interoperability for Earth observation calibration and validation activities |
