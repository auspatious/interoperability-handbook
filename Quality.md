# **Quality**

Quality ensures long term  confidence in the accuracy and consistency of Earth Observation data and products and to provide a forum for the exchange of information about calibration and validation, including the coordination of cooperative activities. 

## Calibration and Validation 

Calibration helps in quantitatively defining a sensor response to known and controlled signal inputs. Validation is the process of assessing the quality of the data

| CALVAL\#1 | CEOS CAL/VAL portal can be used as a reference site for insuring interoperability for calibration and validation |
| :---- | :---- |
| **CALVAL\#2** | CEOS/WGCV developed Data Quality Assurance Strategy should be followed for ensuring interoperability |
| **CALVAL\#3** | CEOS endorsed Cal/Val sites should be used for satellite cross-comparison |
| **CALVAL\#4** |  |
| **CALVAL\#5** |  |
