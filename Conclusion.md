***
The Interoperability Handbook Version 2.0 introduces a five-factor Interoperability Framework that replaces the protocol-centric structure of the Version 1.0:

**Vocabulary (Semantics)**
The new edition emphasizes harmonized, version-controlled vocabularies developed collaboratively across the EO community. It promotes open thesauri, Linked Data principles, and GitHub-based governance. This builds on the 2008 recommendation to use shared glossaries and controlled keywords but adds mechanisms for transparency, participation, and traceability.

**Architecture**
The architecture component is now divided into three layers: Preservation, Data & Metadata, and Publishing. It reaffirms OAIS compliance but expands to include lifecycle management, persistent identifiers, and cloud-optimized formats like STAC, COG, and Zarr. The Version 1.0 focused more narrowly on archiving technologies and metadata formats like DIF and ISO 19115.

**Interface (Accessibility)**
The version 2.0 modernizes data discovery and access by recommending STAC, OpenSearch, and OGC APIs. It discourages zipped data in cloud environments and promotes direct access via HTTP(S), S3, and byte-range requests. In contrast, the 2008 edition emphasized FTP, OpenDAP, and Z39.50, which are now considered legacy or limited in scalability.

**Quality**
Quality assurance is expanded through integration with CEOS WGCV, QA4EO, and traceable uncertainty metrics. The Version 1.0 recommends using CEOS-FRM, RadCalNet, and SARCalNet for calibration and validation. The Version 1.0 introduced Cal/Val concepts but lacked the infrastructure and community maturity now available.

**Policy**
The policy section now includes open data licensing (e.g., CC BY 4.0), open-source software practices, and open science principles. It encourages alignment with GEO data sharing guidelines and the FAIR principles. The 2008 edition focused more on data exchange principles and metadata compliance, without addressing licensing or reproducibility.

# Future Scope
The Handbook Version 2.0 reflects a strategic shift from protocol-level interoperability to ecosystem-level interoperability. It recognizes that modern EO systems must support distributed, cloud-native, and user-driven architectures. The emphasis is on enabling seamless integration across agencies, platforms, and applications—rather than simply connecting catalogs or services.

The CEOS Interoperability Handbook v2.0 is both a continuation and a transformation. It honors the legacy of the Version 1.0 by preserving its core principles—such as openness, standardization, and collaboration—while equipping the EO community with the tools and frameworks needed for the next generation of data systems.

**Interoperability Maturity Matrix** will be developed using the recommendations provided in this handbook. The Maturity Matrix will help users to measure the maturity of Interoperability of data and services in their organizations and will also allow them to monitor the interoperability implementation with time.

**Interoperability Demonstrators** will also be developed using the Interoperability Handbook. These demonstrators will help the end users to understand the barriers in implementing the interoperability and will act as use-cases for Interoperability.
