# **Interface (Accessibility)**
Interfaces allow diversified resources within and across the organization to seamlessly communicate, discover and exchange data. Interfaces are realized in the form of services and follow standards. Interfaces enable data users to have easy and efficient ways of discovering and accessing data and associated services through the exploitation of standard protocols and the harmonizing of search and data retrieval processes

Question (YC): what is the expected granularity of a recommendation ? Each time a pointer to an existing CEOS document or more fine-grained ?

## Data Discovery

| **ID** | **Recommendations** |
| :---- | :---- |
| **DISC\#1** | Collection and granule discovery interfaces should comply with the [CEOS STAC Collection and Granule Discovery Best Practices](https://github.com/ceos-org/stac-collection-and-granule-discovery-best-practices/tree/v1.0.0) (preferred) or [CEOS OpenSearch Best Practices](https://ceos.org/document_management/Working_Groups/WGISS/Documents/WGISS%20Best%20Practices/CEOS%20OpenSearch%20Best%20Practice.pdf). |
| **DISC\#2** | Service and tool discovery interfaces should comply with [CEOS Service Discovery Best Practice](https://ceos.org/document_management/Working_Groups/WGISS/Documents/WGISS%20Best%20Practices/CEOS-Service-Discovery-Best-Practices_V1.1.pdf). |
| **DISC\#3** |  |
| **DISC\#4** |  |
| **DISC\#5** |  |
| **DISC\#6** |  |

## Data Access
| **ID** | **Recommendations** |
| :---- | :---- |
| **DACC\#1** |  Granules should be accessible for access in the cloud via the S3 (Simple Storage Service) protocol. |
| **DACC\#1** |  |
| **DACC\#2** |  |
| **DACC\#3** |  |
| **DACC\#4** |  |
