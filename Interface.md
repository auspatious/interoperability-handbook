Interfaces allow diversified resources within and across the organization to seamlessly communicate,
discover and exchange data. Interfaces are realized in the form of services and follow standards.
Interfaces enable data users to have easy and efficient ways of discovering and accessing data and associated
services through the exploitation of standard protocols and the harmonizing of search and data retrieval processes
