Policy is a statement of intent, which provides guidance for implementation of processes and procedures in an organization. Policies can be at organization/local level or at the government/center level and may have legal bindings. The government level policies take precedence over the organization policies. Institutional mechanism is required to ensure compliance of policies in an organization. The policies are the guiding document for decision making processes in an organization.

Policy is one of the most important factors and forms the basis of interoperability. Following are interoperability recommendations for the policy factor.

| ID | Recommendations |
| :-- | :------------ |
| **POL\#1**| Data providers should participate and engage in relevant community groups/events, such as CEOS, GEO and CGMS, and their respective working groups. Interoperability requires collaboration and coordination between all actors within the sector. |
| **POL\#2**| Identify policies in your organization/country related to data and services and conduct periodic check/audit for compliance to these policies. Identify policies which may be barriers to interoperability of data and services and flag them for resolution. Ensure the policies are clearly communicated to stakeholders. |
| **POL\#3** | **EO Capabilities:** Publish and periodically update information about present and planned Earth observation Satellites in online databases, preferably the [CEOS MIM Database](https://ceos.org/mim-database). This will help in planning and overall coordination among different EO stakeholders. |
| **POL\#4** | **Open Standards and Specifications:** Ensure your organizations implement open standards and specifications such as those published by the Open Geospatial Consortium [(OGC)](https://www.ogc.org/standards/) for data and services. Drafting of new specifications for data formats, metadata formats and service APIs should be preferably done along with standards organisations, or developed by the open source community. |
| **POL\#5** | **Open Data:** Organizations should ensure that Earth observation data is discoverable, accessible and proactively made freely available for use, reuse and redistribution to users in human and machine readable form. |
| **POL\#6** | **Open Source Software:** Where possible, share software applications as open source software, enabling others to use the same tools as are used internally to process or transform data products or to demonstrate the use of standards to access your data and services. An example of a preferred license is Apache 2.0. |
| **POL\#7** | **Open Science:** Promote the concept of open science for collaborative development. Open science ensures availability of the state-of-the-art algorithms and software providing consistent products from different data providers and supporting reproducibility. |
| **POL\#8** | **Data Licensing:** Organizations sharing open and unrestricted data should license the data using an open source license, consistent with their organisation's policy. A Custom license can restrict access for users. The [GEO data licensing Guidance](<https://gkhub.earthobservations.org/packages/p0zg8-02b56>) can be referenced for examples, including Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication (CCo), Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL) v1.0, or Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0). CC BY 4.0 is preferred. |
| **POL\#9** | **Data Procurement from third party:** Organizations planning to procure/outsource Earth Observation data, to possible extent should ensure that the data complies with CEOS recommendations, including those outlined in this handbook.|
| **POL\#10** |**Data preservation:** Organizations should ensure that Earth observation data is archived and preserved according to [CEOS best practices](https://ceos.org/ourwork/workinggroups/wgiss/documents/).|
| **POL\#11** |**Purge Alert:** Organisations should use the [purge alert service](https://ceos.org/ourwork/workinggroups/wgiss/preservation/data-purge-alert/) provided by CEOS WGISS before data and information removal from archives.|
| **POL#12** | Follow the [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) principles to ensure data and metadata interoperability |
